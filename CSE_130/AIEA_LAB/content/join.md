# Join us!

Currently, the AIEA lab is at *capacity* and not seeking new students
to join at this time.  We will update this page as openings become
available.


Interested students are welcome to complete the lab interest [form](https://forms.gle/CpmrgSxGSUvDWo3J7).
We examine new applicants at the start of each quarter (including summer).  

## Prospective PhD students
The AIEA group takes on 1-2 new PhD students each year.  We are seeking creative, hard-working, PhD students to join and lead the group.

Come work with us on making complex mechanisms more understandable for
debugging and diagnosis, accountability, and liability.  We examine
applications in autonomous driving, deep learning, and other
mission-critical or safety-critical applications.  Additionally, the
AIEA lab also examines the role of explanations for trustworthy ML,
human-machine teams, AI and ethics, and AI safety and fairness.  See our [active projects](/project) for more information.

## UCSC Master's students {#ucsc-master-s-students}

Current UCSC Master's students interested in gaining research
experience or looking for a supervisor for a research project should examine the [active projects](/project) and identify a potential research fit. MS students in the AIEA group are expected to to advise and mentor 1-2 undergraduate students.  

In your introductory email, please include a CV/resume, and indicate a
few topics or application domains of interest.  We've listed a couple
ongoing projects on the [UCSC CSE master's board](https://grad.soe.ucsc.edu/cse\/masters_projects).

## UCSC undergrad {#ucsc-undergrad}

UCSC undergraduates are welcome to contact Prof. Gilpin about getting
involved in research. Students interested in joining the group should
have basic programming experience, and preferably, have taken CSE 140.
